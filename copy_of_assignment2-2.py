The position of a ball at time $t$ dropped with zero initial velocity from a height $h_0$ is given by

$y = h_0 - \frac{1}{2} gt^2$

where $g=9.8$ m/s$^2$. Suppose $h_0 = 10$ m. Find the sequence of times when the ball passes each half meter assuming the ball is dropped at $t=0$. Hint: Create a NumPy array for $y$ that goes from 10 to 0 in increments of -0.5 using the `arange` fucntion. Solving the above equation for $t$, we find that

$t = \sqrt{\frac{2\left(h_0 -y\right)}{g}}$

Using this equation and the array you created, find the sequence of times when the ball passes each half meter. Your code should yield the following results for the $y$ and $t$ arrays:

```
In [2]: y
Out[2]: array([10. , 9.5, 9. , 8.5, 8. , 7.5, 7. , 6.5,

                2. , 1.5, 1. , 0.5])

Recalling that the average velocity over an interval $\Delta t$ is defined as $\bar{v}=\Delta y/ \Delta t$, find the average velocity for each time interval in the previous problem using NumPy arrays. Keep in mind that the number of time intervals is one less than the number of times. Hint: What are the arrays `y[1:20]` and `y[0:19]`? What does the array `y[1:20]-y[0:19]` represent? (Try printing out the two arrays from the IPython shell.) Using this last array and a similar one involving time, find the array of average velocities. Bonus: Can you think of a more elegant way of representing `y[1:20]-y[0:19]` that does not make explicit reference to the number of elements in the `y` array--one that would work for any length array?

You should get the following answer for the array of velocities:

```
